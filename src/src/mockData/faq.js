        question: "What are the financial issues involved for an exchange student?",
        answer: "The university tuition/scholarship situation remains unchanged for the exchange student. The student continues to receive his scholarship or pay his tuition to his home institution (Bilkent University) as he would do otherwise, of the same amount. An exchange visit involves several other costs as well, such as the travel, accommodation, and living expenses. These expenses can be expected roughly to be in the order of 1000 USD/month, although this figure may vary significantly depending on the place as well as the person. Erasmus students receive an EU support of 400 Euro/month to cover part of their expenses.",
